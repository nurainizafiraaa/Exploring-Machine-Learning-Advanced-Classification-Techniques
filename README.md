# üìû Telco Customer Churn Prediction ‚Äì Supervised Machine Learning
### Data Science & Data Analyst Bootcamp  
Module: *Exploring Machine Learning Models with Python (Classification Techniques)*


## üéØ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using **Supervised Machine Learning classification algorithms**.  
I aim to analyze customer behavior patterns to identify which customers are likely to leave (churn) and provide data-driven insights for customer retention strategies.

## üß† Objectives
- Perform **data preparation** and handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data patterns and relationships.
- Apply **feature engineering** for categorical encoding, scaling, and transformation.
- Build and compare **Supervised Learning models** (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Evaluate models using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC**.
- Interpret model results and provide actionable **business insights**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Information
**Dataset Source:**  
[Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YEw9yPDv4p5jw475P8S-haq9zycW6qWf/view?usp=sharing)

Each record represents a customer with demographic and service-related attributes.

| Column | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `customerID` | Unique customer identifier |
| `gender` | Gender (Male/Female) |
| `SeniorCitizen` | Whether the customer is a senior citizen |
| `Partner`, `Dependents` | Family-related attributes |
| `tenure` | Number of months the customer has stayed |
| `PhoneService`, `InternetService`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies` | Subscription details |
| `Contract`, `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod` | Contract and billing information |
| `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges` | Customer billing data |
| `Churn` | Target variable (Yes/No) |
